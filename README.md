# TwitchPlays #WIP#
These are the two Python files I use that allows Twitch Chat or Youtube Chat to control your keyboard or mouse to play a game. You are welcome to use or adapt this code for your own content.

To run the code you will need to install Python 3.12.  
Additionally, you will need to install the following python modules using Pip:  
python -m pip install keyboard  
python -m pip install pydirectinput  
python -m pip install pyautogui  
python -m pip install pynput  
python -m pip install requests  
python -m pip install mouse  
python -m pip install tkinter  
python -m pip install mttkinter  

Once Python is set up, ~~simply change the Twitch username (or Youtube channel ID) in TwitchPlays_TEMPLATE.py~~ all you need to do it boot up the program and follow the prompts, and you'll be ready to go.

This code is originally based off Wituz's Twitch Plays template, then expanded by DougDoug and DDarknut with help from Ottomated for the Youtube side. For now I am not reviewing any pull requests or code changes, this code is meant to be a simple prototype that is uploaded for educational purposes (DougDoug's words but I will honor them too). But feel free to fork the project and create your own version! 

This is a forked version of the expanded Twitch/Youtube Plays done by DougDoug, DDarknut, Ottomated, and the original coder Wituz. I decided to further expand this program to allow people with little coding knowledge to have options and a GUI
