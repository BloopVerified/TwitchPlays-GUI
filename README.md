# TwitchPlays GUI
These are the two Python files I use that allows Twitch Chat or Youtube Chat to control your keyboard or mouse to play a game. You are welcome to use or adapt this code for your content (Please credit all programmers if you plan to use this as a base for your own project.)

To run the code you will need to install Python 3.12.  
Additionally, you will need to install the following python modules using Pip:  
> python -m pip install keyboard  
python -m pip install pydirectinput  
python -m pip install pyautogui  
python -m pip install pynput  
python -m pip install requests  
python -m pip install mouse  
python -m pip install tkinter  
python -m pip install mttkinter  
python -m pip install screeninfo  

Once Python is set up, all you need to do is boot up the program and follow the prompts, and you'll be ready to go!

This is a forked version of the expanded Twitch/Youtube Plays by DougDoug, DDarknut, Ottomated, and the original Twitch/Youtube Plays coder Wituz. I decided to expand this program further to allow people with little coding knowledge to have pre-set and custom options with a basic but decent GUI.
